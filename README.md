# E-Commerce Sales Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes the sales data of a Brazilian e-commerce store from 2016 to 2018. The primary objectives are to understand sales trends across different states, identify states with declining or increasing trends, perform a root cause analysis for their performance, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Objectives

### 1. Metrics Calculation
For each year and state, calculate the following metrics:

Analyze if these metrics show similar trends or disparities.

### 2. Trend Identification
Identify the top 2 states with:
- **Declining trends** over the years
- **Increasing trends** over the years

Use the most suitable metrics among sales, customer acquisitions, and total number of orders for this analysis.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
Conduct a detailed analysis for the identified states using various metrics:
- Category-level sales and orders placed
- Post-order reviews
- Seller performance in terms of deliveries
- Product-level sales and orders placed
- Percentage of orders delivered earlier or later than the expected date

### 4. City-Level Analysis
Perform the above analysis for the top 2 cities contributing to the trends in each of the identified states.

### 5. Recommendations
Based on the root cause analysis, suggest ways to improve the performance of the identified states and cities.
